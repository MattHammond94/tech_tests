# Breakdown:

- Each frame consists of a max of 2 rolls 

- EXCEPT frame 10 which has a max of 3

- If the player hits a strike on roll one (10) the frame ends.

Bonus':

> Strike: 
> the bonus for this frame will be the total number of pins knocked down over the next 2 ROLLS (meaning the next frame unless another strike is hit.)

> Spare:
> A spare is if 10 pins are knocked down in 2 rolls.
> Bonus for this is the first roll of the next frame. 

> Gutter: 
> Player doesn't hit a single pin. 0 points.

> Perfect:
> 12 strikes. (10 reg strikes and 2 in the bonus.) 300 points.

> 10th frame: 
> Strike or spare rolled on 10th frame then they can roll the remaining bonus rolls (2 if strike - 1 if spare.)

# Plan

@current_frame = 0
@total_score = 0

A frame => Takes two args (roll, score) => (1, 5)
